### `How useState works`
Before React v16 we could not use states in a functional components, but now useState hooks allows us to use state in a functional component useState hooks function is called with a initial state, ant it returns an array of 2 variables. One is to access the state and another is to set the state

in a class component state is declared using this.state, but in a functional component useState hook can handle the functionality of the state of a component. There are many hooks used in React to make the logic of application simple. useState hook make to store the state data in a simpler way By using useState hook react virtual DOM can quick identify the changes in the dom and apply only the changes efficiently
